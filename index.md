István Heckenberger is a distinguished German mathematician who specializes in Hopf algebras, Nichols algebras, quantum groups, and related algebraic structures. He is currently a Full Professor at Philipps University of Marburg in Germany. Heckenberger has made seminal contributions to several areas of modern algebra, including differential calculi on quantum groups and quantum spaces, the theory of Nichols algebras, Weyl groupoids, and arithmetic root systems. He is also the coauthor, with Hans-Jürgen Schneider, of the comprehensive book [Hopf Algebras and Root Systems](https://bookstore.ams.org/surv-247/).

### Inaugural lecture

_On some beautiful children of abstract algebra_  
Thursday, Feb 12, 15:00. Room G.6.52. 

Abstract: From time to time, abstract algebraic structures like Nichols
algebras produce during their studies interesting, rather elementary but
non-trivial mathematical structures. In the lecture I will demonstrate
two of such structures, frieze patterns of integers and the hyperplane
geometry of Weyl groupoids.


Registration for the Inaugural Lecture is free but mandatory: [here](https://forms.office.com/e/jK1aYWKtmB).

### Course

_Nichols algebras and root systems_  

Abstract: Today the theory of Nichols algebras looks back to a rapid
development, which started already in the 20th century. In the course I
will explain in detail the basic structures and some powerful
combinatorial tools to study these abstract algebraic objects. Some
classification results will be discussed. As a prerequisite I will
assume the knowledge of tensor products and very basic categorical and
non-commutative algebraic structures.
