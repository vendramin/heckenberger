István Heckenberger is a distinguished German mathematician who specializes in Hopf algebras, Nichols algebras, quantum groups, and related algebraic structures. He is currently a Full Professor at Philipps University of Marburg in Germany. Heckenberger has made seminal contributions to several areas of modern algebra, including differential calculi on quantum groups and quantum spaces, the theory of Nichols algebras, Weyl groupoids, and arithmetic root systems. He is also the coauthor, with Hans-Jürgen Schneider, of the comprehensive book [Hopf Algebras and Root Systems](https://bookstore.ams.org/surv-247/).
